# In Kubernetes, a ConfigMap is an object that allows you to store configuration
# data that your application needs to run, separate from the application's code.
# It provides a way to decouple the application's configuration from the
# application itself, which can be useful in scenarios where the same application
# is deployed to multiple environments (e.g. development, staging, production),
# each with different configuration values.

# A ConfigMap consists of two main parts: metadata and data.

# The metadata contains information about the ConfigMap,
# such as its name, namespace, labels, and annotations.
# The data section contains key-value pairs of the actual configuration data.
